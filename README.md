# Oil Spill Detector
This is an underwater oil spill detector which uses 2 light dependent resistors to compare the light intensity in each sensors. The sensor reading values vary when an unidentified object obstructs light which is directed to the light dependent resistor.

This project uses NodeMCU v1.0, 2 light dependent resistors, and an additional 4015 multiplexer IC.
